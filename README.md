This is a backup copy of a "Mario Kart" type game I made for my Grade 12 Computer Science Project. It uses many fundamental concepts such as Object Oriented Programming, AI and a psuedo-3d graphics interface.

To see the final product please go to:

Final Game --> Mario Kart 1P Game Final.java and run it (must have all the files in the same directory)

Or, to run the multiplayer version of the game go to:

Final Game --> Mario Kart 2P Final Version.java

	Controls:

	up - up arrow
	down - down arrow
	left - left arrow
	right - right arrow
	drift (sharp turn ) - e
	use item - f
